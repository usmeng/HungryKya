Project HungryKya
Team: Payal , Meng, Tristan

The idea of the project is to help the user find food to eat and in a fast manner. The app can also save the users earlier choice to 
suggest more options.

Idea: 
1) The application will launch with a splash screen which will in background collect the user location. Based on the location, 
the application will use Yelp API to get all the food joints within 5 mile radius for the user
2) The main screen will show up all the nearby locations with the star ratings and cuisine type to the user
3) The user will also have an option to search a restaurant of his choice using search bar
4) The user can also filter through the search using type eg: American, Thai, Italian etc.
